Student Math Problem Solving Modeling

<p align="justify">
This library models student math problem solving behavior using <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abeutel/kdd2015_tutorial/">graph model</a>. Specifically, it blends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_tutor">cognitive tutor</a> and <a href="http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/koedinger/pubs/CTAT-IJAIED-2008.pdf"> example-based tutor </a> paradigms to support automatic answer checking, multiple solution tracing without human authoring effort.
