# BehaviorGraph
User Modeling toward student modeling domain

A behavior graph is a directed, acyclic graph that represents acceptable
ways of solving a problem. The links in the graph represent problem-solving
actions, and the nodes represent problem-solving state.

A behavior graph may contain multiple paths, corresponding to different ways
of solving a problem. It may also contain links that represent incorrect 
behavior, marked as such by the author who created the graph.
